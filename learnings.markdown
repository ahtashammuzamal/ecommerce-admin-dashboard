Great question — when your sidebar has `position: fixed`, it’s **removed from the normal flow**, so you need to handle scrolling **within the sidebar itself** using explicit height and overflow styles.

---

### ✅ Solution: Make the sidebar **scrollable vertically** by setting:

* `h-screen` → full viewport height
* `overflow-y-auto` → enable vertical scrolling

---

### 🔧 Tailwind Example:

```jsx
<div className="fixed w-72 h-screen overflow-y-auto bg-white dark:bg-secondary-dark-bg">
  <Sidebar />
</div>
```

### 🔍 Explanation:

| Class             | Purpose                                        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `fixed`           | Pins the sidebar to the screen                 |
| `w-72`            | Sidebar width                                  |
| `h-screen`        | Full height of the viewport                    |
| `overflow-y-auto` | Enables scroll if content overflows vertically |

---

### 🚫 Common Mistake:

If you forget `h-screen`, the sidebar has no height limit — so it grows with content and can’t scroll.

---

### ✅ Bonus (for better UX):

Add Tailwind scrollbar classes for nicer appearance (with a plugin) or use:

```css
/* Tailwind plugin config (optional) */
overflow-y-scroll scrollbar-thin scrollbar-thumb-rounded-md scrollbar-thumb-gray-400
```

Or basic Tailwind without plugin:

```jsx
<div className="fixed w-72 h-screen overflow-y-auto">...</div>
```

Let me know if your sidebar has a header or footer — I can show how to make only the middle section scrollable too!
